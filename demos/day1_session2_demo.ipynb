    "# Day 1, Session 2: ReAct Pattern in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Intelligent Agents with Reasoning + Acting\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes an Agent Different?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional programming follows this pattern:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def process_invoice(invoice_id):\n",
    "    data = extract_data(invoice_id)\n",
    "    validation = validate_rules(data)\n",
    "    return make_decision(validation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you don't know ahead of time what steps you'll need? What if the process depends on what you discover along the way?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents solve this by reasoning about what to do next:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Agent pattern\n",
    "while not done:\n",
    "    thought = llm.think(\"What should I do next?\")\n",
    "    action = choose_action(thought)\n",
    "    observation = execute_action(action)\n",
    "    context += observation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ReAct Pattern: Reasoning + Acting\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct combines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with the precision of programmatic tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"Process invoice INV-2024-001\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:\n",
    "THOUGHT: I need to first get the invoice data to understand what I'm working with\n",
    "ACTION: extract_invoice_data(\"INV-2024-001\")\n",
    "OBSERVATION: {\"vendor\": \"TechCorp\", \"amount\": 15000, \"terms\": \"Net 30\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2:\n",
    "THOUGHT: Now I need to check if these payment terms are acceptable for this amount\n",
    "ACTION: validate_payment_terms(\"Net 30\", 15000)\n",
    "OBSERVATION: {\"approved\": true, \"reason\": \"Standard terms for this amount\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3:\n",
    "THOUGHT: Everything looks good, I can approve this invoice\n",
    "ACTION: FINISH\n",
    "RESULT: \"Invoice approved for payment\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Invoice Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional automation breaks when:**\n",
    "- Invoice formats vary unexpectedly\n",
    "- New business rules need to be applied\n",
    "- Exception handling requires human-like reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents handle this by:**\n",
    "- Adapting their approach based on what they discover\n",
    "- Combining multiple tools intelligently\n",
    "- Explaining their reasoning for auditability\n",

Context Awareness:**\nEach step builds on previous observations. Notice how the mock_llm checks for \"Step 1\", \"Step 2\" in the prompt to determine what has already been discovered.\n\n**2. Structured Decision Making:**\nEvery action is preceded by explicit reasoning about what information is needed next.\n\n**3. Tool Integration:**\nThe agent doesn't just reason - it takes concrete actions using available tools to gather real data.\n\n**4. Adaptive Flow:**\nUnlike rigid programming, the agent's next step depends on what it observes, allowing for flexible problem-solving.\n\n### Why This Works Better Than Pure LLM\n\n**Pure LLM Response:**\n\"I would process the invoice by checking the data, validating terms, and calculating due dates.\"\n*(Describes what it would do, but can't actually do it)*\n\n**ReAct Agent Response:**\nActually extracts real data ‚Üí Validates actual terms ‚Üí Calculates precise due dates ‚Üí Provides actionable result\n*(Does the work and provides verifiable results)*\n\nThis is the power of combining reasoning with execution!",

    "**Token Economics:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Typical invoice processing agent execution\n",
    "Step 1: ~500 tokens (initial reasoning + invoice extraction)\n",

    "Cost: ~$0.00125 at $0.001/1K tokens\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Optimization Strategies:**\n",

    "def get_vendor_history(vendor_name):\n",
    "    return database.query_vendor_history(vendor_name)\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Process multiple invoices with shared context\n",
    "def process_invoice_batch(invoice_ids):\n",
    "    # Load vendor data once for the batch\n",
