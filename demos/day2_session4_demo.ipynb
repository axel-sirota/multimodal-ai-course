    "\n",
    "An enterprise-grade batch processing system that:\n",
    "1. **Integrates Smart Routing** - Uses Session 3's routing engine for each document\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Parallelism** - Scales workers based on routing decisions\n",
    "3. **Cost-Aware Batching** - Optimizes batches for cost and performance\n",
    "4. **Route Distribution** - Balances Fast, Balanced, Accurate, and Premium routes\n",
    "5. **Real-time Monitoring** - Tracks progress across all parallel workers\n",
    "\n",
    "This bridges **intelligent routing** with **enterprise-scale batch processing**.\n",
