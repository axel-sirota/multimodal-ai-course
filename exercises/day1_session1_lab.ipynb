    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will:\n",
    "1. Set up Google Colab with GPU acceleration\n",
    "2. Install and configure the transformers library\n",
    "3. Implement 3 different pipelines for invoice processing\n",
    "4. Monitor and optimize memory usage\n",
    "5. Compare CPU vs GPU performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully completed this lab when you can:\n",
    "- ✅ Run all three pipeline tasks without errors\n",
    "- ✅ Achieve < 1 second inference time on GPU\n",
    "- ✅ Extract correct information from sample invoice text\n",
    "- ✅ Demonstrate GPU memory management\n",
