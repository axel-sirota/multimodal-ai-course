    "\n",
    "## Building Production-Ready Agent Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll build sophisticated agent workflows using LangGraph, implementing state management, conditional routing, parallel execution, and error recovery. This represents the current state-of-the-art in production agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will:\n",
    "1. Design and implement stateful workflows with LangGraph\n",
    "2. Create conditional routing based on processing results\n",
    "3. Implement parallel tool execution for performance\n",
    "4. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery\n",
    "5. Build a complete invoice approval workflow\n",
    "6. Add state persistence and checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully completed this lab when you can:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Create a workflow with at least 5 nodes and conditional routing\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Handle multiple error scenarios gracefully\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Demonstrate parallel execution of validation steps\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Save and restore workflow state\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Process invoices end-to-end with full audit trail\n",
